Obiective:
Develop a fully functional, dynamic product page in Shopify that mirrors the provided Figma
design. All product variations, pricing, and subscription details must be pulled from the Shopify
backend. The page should support a rich, interactive Ul while maintaining performance and
responsive behavior.
Scope of Work
1. Product Media Gallery
Implement a product image carousel.
Thumbnail click should update the main image dynamically
Images should reflect selected product variants (e.g.,color/flavor)
2. Purchase Options (Radio Group with Dynamic ui)
Implement two purchase modes as radio buttons:
-Single Drink Subscription-Double Drink Subscription
Each selection should dynamically update flavor selectors and pricing.
Show included items, discounts, and benefits per mode.(should come from product details
in the Shopify backend)
Reflect correct variants from the Shopify backend.
The Subscription Price should be 25% off from the Main Price. Plus all the items will have a
20% sales discount. So, For example, if Main Price is $100, then the subscription main price
will be $75. and after 20% sales discount on both, the final pricing will become (20% on $100
=$80ï¼‰.

Single Drink: 1 flavor selector
Double Drink: 2 selectors (Flavor 1 and Flavor 2)
selections must reflect appropriate variants and be required to proceed.
